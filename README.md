# Statistical Operations in Python

This project allows users to perform various statistical operations on a set of numbers. The available operations include calculating the **mean**, **median**, **standard deviation**, **variance**, **minimum**, **maximum**, **index of minimum**, **index of maximum**, and specific **percentiles**.

## Features

- **Mean**: The average of the numbers.
- **Median**: The middle value of the numbers.
- **Standard Deviation**: A measure of the spread of the numbers.
- **Variance**: The squared spread of the numbers.
- **Minimum Value**: The smallest value in the list.
- **Maximum Value**: The largest value in the list.
- **Index of Minimum Value**: The index where the minimum value occurs.
- **Index of Maximum Value**: The index where the maximum value occurs.
- **Percentile**: A specific percentile (e.g., 50th percentile, 90th percentile, etc.).
